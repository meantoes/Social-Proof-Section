## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used chrome to see another screen size but the dev tool kinda take my entire screen so it wasn't comfortable. I found the solution in Kevil Powel's video that I can use Firefox instead and I think it's more convinience. I wish I knew this earlier.

I also discovered new way to make the design flexible: use min property haha. I still find it difficult to use alike properties value tho like minmax, min-width, etc.
I also discovered the way to reset css: using reset.css, thanks to [him](https://youtu.be/p1zJExpDvxs) from scrimba that gave list of Junior Developer checklist.
